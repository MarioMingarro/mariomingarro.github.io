# _Research_

My study focuses on how climate change and the dynamics of land use can affect protected areas. Through different analyzes it is possible to know if these spaces are going to preserve the environmental conditions that they currently protect and thus model the possibility of connection with those places that will have, in the future, the environmental conditions that these protected spaces currently have. In this way, the possibility arises of being able to create ecological corridors in accordance with these threats, being a tool to present to managers and thus be able to make decisions taking into account potential threats. I also work with the analysis of environmental variables for diurnal lepidopterans in the Iberian Peninsula, in order to better understand how climate change affects them.
